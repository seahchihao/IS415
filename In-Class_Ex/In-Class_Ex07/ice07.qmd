> Some learning from this lesson:
Look deeply into the data and is there assuptions or outliers (e.g. more data due to higher population), and how to counter these to ensure a more interesting analysis? (i.e. take data per capita, to find out the true distribution of data, not affected by poplation size)
Stadardisation techniques can also be used, depending on context. (z-score, min-max, decimal-scaling)

No linear relationship != no relationship
